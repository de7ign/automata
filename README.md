## About
Automata playground aims to simulate the creation of finite state machines and interact with the FSM with various algorithms.

It's still in early stage, lot of basic and core functionality is still incomplete, basic UI/UX is complete although. It has some quirks and many parts are not yet available.

However feel free to visit the [playground](https://nihalmurmu.me/automata) and if you want to start a discussion, report bugs or propose a awesome feature, you're welcome to open a [issue](https://github.com/nihalmurmu/automata/issues)

My future view of this project is :
* User can draw finite state machines and import and export in various formats (dot, json, svg, jpg, latex)
* User can use automata algorithms over the finite state model.
* This will help students to understand better through visualization and faculties can use this to avoid wasting time in drawing and going step-by-step explanation. The application will handle most of it.

## Installation
If you want to take a tour of the web application, application is deployed for you in the [playground](http://nihalmurmu.github.io/automata)

if you still want to run this project locally clone this repo on your local machine and run
```
$ cd cloned-repo/
$ npm install   // It will install all the dependencies
$ npm start     // It will launch the application on `http://localhost:3000`
```
